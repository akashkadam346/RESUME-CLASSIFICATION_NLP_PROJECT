# RESUME-CLASSIFICATION_Project-P-145
This project is base on NLP and we work on the topic of Resume Classification. 

# Problem Statements:

Today the major problem being faced across the industry is how to acquire the right talent, using minimal resources over the internet and in minimal time. As described there are three major challenges that are required to be overcome, to bring efficiencies to the complete process.

•-> Separating the right candidates from the pack 
•-> Making sense of candidate CVs
•-> Knowing that candidates can do the job before you hire them

# Business Objective:

Our group intends to provide a solution to the above-mentioned challenges by automating the process. The document classification solution should significantly reduce the manual human effort in the HRM and financial department. It should achieve a higher level of accuracy and automation with minimal human intervention.
